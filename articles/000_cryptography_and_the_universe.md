# Cryptography and the Universe

The universe believes in encryption. Julian Assange [0]

Rachel-Rose O'Leary's article "Memetic Warfare" [1] and Jonathan Cook's article
"The fates of Gaza and Julian Assange are sealed together" [2] inspired us to
capture our thoughts on the role of cryptography in liberation struggles and
to humbly contribute frameworks for dialogue between the camps of technologists
and revolutionaries.

What inspired us specifically was the connection between Assange, Palestine
and Lunarpunk.

Assange is a journalist who was imprisoned in 2010 for reporting on United
States war crimes. He and the many others who fight for transparency into the
powerful are routinely attacked for carrying out the sacred duty of building
informed publics. Assange was also a cypherpunk who urged us to defuse
unchecked power with cryptography, which allows us to bypass the global
surveillance complex and establish unmediated relations between each other [3].

Palestine is similarly attacked and imprisoned. Subject to endless assault by
the same surveillance and military complex, it has been colonized and turned
into a landed aircraft carrier to serve Western imperial interests [4]. Gaza
is now a "mass assassination factory" [5] at the whim of an economy dependent
on regional suffering. Israel systematically bullies millions of people into
acts of desperation and feeds these people and acts into its industry like a
raw material to produce human control systems to sell on the global market [6]
[7]. From the on-the-ground atrocities, to the media censorship [8], to
the extrajudicial surveillance of protesters [9], to the McCarthyite
harassment of Universities [10] and witch hunts of their scholars [11], we
witness in real time the machinations of the transnational dystopia Assange
warned us about. And it does not begin or end with Palestine. As human control
systems are developed there and elsewhere, Gaza is only the most conspicuous
instance today of an ancient system that has been kicked into overdrive
with recent technologies.

Enter Lunarpunk, partially inspired by Assange. In the same way that Assange
and Palestine are branded criminals by the reigning powers and praised as heroes
by the majority of the world, Lunarpunk encourages technologists to look beyond
the noise of harassment and accusations of criminality to realize the heroic
mission of creating new worlds. Reimagining and reconstructing new worlds is
a primary freedom [12] and it is our birthright to bring them into existence by
any means necessary. There are infinite potential worlds hidden in plain sight,
and the strategic development of technology can help cultivate them outside
the reach of the dystopia surrounding us. It is the duty of technologists
to facilitate this growth.

In the articles ahead we'll explore these ideas and the technologies that
provide supportive infrastructure for the realization of human potential. With
all their pervasiveness, it's easy to forget that information technologies are
still young. As they grow it's essential we develop sovereign infrastructures
that integrate with and strengthen organic communities, rather than enslave
them. Cryptography gives us the tools to do this, and with the collaboration of
technologists and revolutionaries we can bring these new worlds into
existence. Let us proceed together apace.

Onward.
